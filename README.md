Introduction
----
Simulations of liquid democracy that show if voters who delegate their votes
tend to be the most politically ignorant and if voters tend to delegate their
votes to someone more knowledgeable than themselves, then the political
knowledge of the direct voters will increase dramatically.

Results of the simulations are presented in a paper to be published by Emil O.
W. Kirkegaard and Bo Tranberg.
